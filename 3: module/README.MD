# Modules

Modules are the building blocks of your application. They are the place where you define your models, controllers, views, and other components.

## Module Structure

A module is a directory that contains the following files:

- `README.MD` - A description of the module.
- `package.json` - A file that contains the module's metadata and dependencies.
- `index.js` - The entry point of the module.
