# Buffers

## Introduction

Buffers are a way to store data in a temporary location. The data is stored in a buffer as a sequence of bytes. Buffers are useful because they can be read and written to very quickly.

## Creating a Buffer

There are a number of ways to create a buffer. The simplest way is to use the `Buffer.alloc()` method. This method allocates a buffer of a specified size. The following example allocates a buffer of 10 bytes:

```js
const buf = Buffer.alloc(10);
```

# Streams

## Introduction

Streams are a way to read and write data in chunks. Streams are useful because they allow you to process large amounts of data without having to load it all into memory at once.
